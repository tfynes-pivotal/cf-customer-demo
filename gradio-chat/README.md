Gradio Chat will require GenAI for TAS to start correctly.

Provision the GenAI service:

Create a service instance for the GenAI for TAS "shared-ai-plan" - using the service name `gradio-chat-genai-service`

~~~
 ~ cf create-service genai-service shared-ai-plan gradio-chat-genai-service
Creating service instance gradio-chat-genai-service in org kuhn-labs / space homelab as admin...

Service instance gradio-chat-genai-service created.
OK

Now that the services have been provisioned, go ahead and push the application.
